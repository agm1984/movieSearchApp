# Movie Search App
This is basically a boilerplate for an HTTP request app.

## Packages Used
- Express
- EJS
- request
- body-parser

Bodyparser is added but not used. It can be safely removed if you will not be using req.body or any activity with POST requests.

# UI
This app is responsively designed with flexbox. Some media queries should be added for viewport widths nearing 350-400px. It was hastily designed for desktop with a card-based layout.

To support mobile sizing, simply change the images to be approximately 75% of their current dimensions.
